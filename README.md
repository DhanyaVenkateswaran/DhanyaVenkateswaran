# Hello there! :polar_bear:

I am Dhanya Venkateswaran, a pre-final year student from College of Engineering Guindy. I hate any and all sorts of chores that require physical activity and thus, I LOVE CODING. Thinking about my previous statement, I do love to play outdoor sports so I'm not a complete couch potato :) 
I'm absolutely terrified of reptiles but somehow python is my favourite coding language. My current jam is machine learning and data science and any words of wisdom on those topics (or literally anything else in life) are encouraged!
